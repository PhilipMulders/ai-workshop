## What is it made of, the components ðŸ§±

At its core, the [slim](https://www.slimframework.com) micro framework is used.
All starts in [index.php](../public/index.php), the external libraries and components
are loaded, using the `autoload` file generated by composer.

Thereafter, the [bootstrap](../config/bootstrap.php) file is required. This file load the basics needed by the application:

- Loading of env vars, described in .env
- Creation of the dependency container, and setting up autowiring
- Configuring the twig templating engine with the Symfony form helpers
- Registering the Symfony form factory as a service

The [routes](../config/routes.php) file will be used bind controllers to the appropriate paths

In [services](../config/services.php), we will configure services that need specific orchestration
that is not possible with the containers autowiring functionality.

Once all the bootstrapping and config is loaded, the App is started using `$app->run()`.

## CLI Usage

The symfony console component is used to run cli script/commands. These are
ran using the executable [console script](../bin/console.php).

Example: `php bin/console <command-name>`
